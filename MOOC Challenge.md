Comments/ resume of MOOC 

A computational document is a type of file that combines: code, data, results and where the main goal is to enhance transparency and traceability in research.
It allows anyone to access to your data and reports, to reproduce yours experiments, criticize your project and also to continue your work.

Having traceability in yours studies is essential.
It helps to collaborate with transparent analysisis and not forguet what you have done.
It is also usefull to chech your information if somethings goes wrong. 

There are several examples where trazability was missing and their studies failed. Examples of that are:
- Economics - Reinhart & Rogoff (2010) their study claimed that when public debt exceeded 90 % of GDP, economic growth became negative. Later, other researchers tried to replicate it and found several problems: a spreadsheet formula error that excluded five countries, unequal weighting of data, and selective data omissions. Once corrected, the supposed “90 % threshold” disappeared. This case shows the importance of sharing data and code for verification.
- Neuroscience - Dead Fish study. Brain imaging allows us to observe somebody's brain activity. while they are performing a task. It helps us understand how the brain works and is structured.. Contrafact: they put a death fish and realized and hey noticed signs of brain activity → The raw data obtained during an MRI has a lot of noise.. If the data was allowd to anyone perhaps it will be detected on time.
- Structural Biology – Geoffrey Chang Case: published articles in famous magazines  about the structure of proteins present in cell membranes. He found different results as other studios and after analysis realized that he inherited the code from another lab and it had been used by other teams.Even if the data had been carefully acquired, the analysis had not.

So transparency is escential to avoid errors in all the studies.

Types of computational documents: 
- Jupiter Notebook: usefull for code, data and graph. Can use cloud in order to share the documents.
- RStudio: usefull with R better for statistical analyses but is not practical to share with other people, You need to have it local. 
- Emacs / org-mode text + code. More technical, to create technical notes or documents. Is more powerfull than to put text, code and graph.
- R: 



This tools are usefull to create documents that can be exported to pdf, html but it is not usefull when we want to share the documentation and accept the opinions of others 
So here there are some different types of tools to share documents:

RPubs: Fast and easy but data hosted temporarly
Dropbox: Simple. No version control, no guarantee
GitLab/GitHub: Version control and colaroboration. All the information is publish you must clean the repository first and save a version of what you have submit.

To pick up the best it will depend on the coauthors, any technical, confidentiality and copyright constraints. 
And there will be some difficulties but there are solutions, keep trying.
