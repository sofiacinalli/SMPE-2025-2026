## MOOC Excercise 7: Reproduction of Rstudio Code

For this Challenger exercise, I chose to work with RStudio. Setting everything up was a bit challenging at first, mainly because I made some mistakes with the GitHub/GitLab connections. Once the environment was configured, I ran into another issue: the package ggplot2 was not installed. When running Error in library(ggplot) because it wasn't built: 
I solved it by installing the package directly in RStudio using: install.packages("ggplot2")

Later, when I tried to export the document to PDF, I realized that I needed additional tools (TinyTeX/LaTeX) to generate the output, which required some extra installation steps.

RStudio seems to have more potential in terms of data analysis and report generation, but coding in R feels a bit more challenging compared to other languages. However, once the environment is correctly set up, the workflow becomes smoother—and the effort pays off, because these tools are essential for producing reproducible and professional documents.
