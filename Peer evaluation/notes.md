# Subject 6: Around Simpson's Paradox

## Overview
In this work, we analyze the results of a survey conducted in Whickham, a town in the north-east of England located approximately 6.5 kilometres south-west of Newcastle upon Tyne.  
The objective of the original study was to investigate thyroid and heart disease.

The survey was conducted in two periods:
- an initial study carried out between 1972 and 1974 to collect baseline information,
- a follow-up study conducted approximately 20 years later to assess the health status of the participants.

This project focuses on the relationship between smoking habits, age, and mortality, and illustrates the well-known **Simpson's Paradox**.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about women from the Whickham study who were classified as *current smokers* or *never smokers* at the time of the first survey.

For each individual, the following variables are available:
- **Smoking status**: smoker / non-smoker 
- **Vital status**: alive / dead at follow-up
- **Age**: age at the time of the first survey

## Tools
- **R** (RStudio)
