Graph analysis 

Some notes of the class: 
If you are the reader:
  1. Analyze the data, pay attention to who is doing the analysis. (sometimes they are talking to s
  2. If you can access to the information then look at it, try to analyze in another way.
  3. Pay attention to the context. perhaps they are traing to force some interpretation.
If you are doing the graph:
  1. pay attention to who is going to read it. Is not the same information or the same references that you can use when it is for people that are into the subject that you are talking to than those ones that are not into.
  2. put the information in order
  3. pay attention what is going to happend when the readers see your graph. Ex, if they are going to print it on black and white perhaps they don't see the different references that you are using.
  4. the graph depends on the data that you are representing.
  5. make more than one graph and choose the most clear and simple
