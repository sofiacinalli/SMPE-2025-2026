Graph analysis 

Some notes of the class: 
If you are the reader:
  1. Analyze the data, pay attention to who is doing the analysis. (sometimes they are talking to s
  2. If you can access to the information then look at it, try to analyze in another way.
  3. Pay attention to the context. perhaps they are traing to force some interpretation.
If you are doing the graph:
  1. pay attention to who is going to read it. Is not the same information or the same references that you can use when it is for people that are into the subject that you are talking to than those ones that are not into.
  2. put the information in order
  3. pay attention what is going to happend when the readers see your graph. Ex, if they are going to print it on black and white perhaps they don't see the different references that you are using.
  4. the graph depends on the data that you are representing.
  5. make more than one graph and choose the most clear and simple

Some analysis of the graph using the check list:
First graph: 
<img width="382" height="258" alt="GRAPH  - LE CHOMAGE" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d933e82b-0334-4178-9d89-38cbda2699c3" />

DATA:
1. YES. The type of graph is adapted to the nature of the data. 
2. YES. Approximations/interpolation make sense. The data that they are showing is not the same so I think that is confused but the 
3. NO. Curves are defined by a sufficient number of points. NO I will use X-DISTANT POINT in order to be compared
4. YES. The building method of the curve is clear : interpolation (linear, polynomial,regression...). 
5. NO. Confidence intervals are visualized (or given separately)
6. NO. Steps of histograms are adequate
7. NO. Histograms visualize probabilities (from 0 to 1).

Graphical objects
1. YES. Graphical objects are readable on screen, on printed version (B/W), on video... ;
2. YES. Graphic range is standard, without too similar colors, without green (video) 
3. NO. Graphical axis are well identified and labelled;
4. YES. Scales and units are explicits;
5. YES. Curves cross without ambiguity;
6. YES. Grids help the reader.

Annotations
1. NO. Axis are labelled by quantities;
2. NO. Labels of the axis are clear, and self contained;
3. NO. Units are indicated on the axis;
4. YES. Axes are oriented from the left to the right and from the bottom to the top;
5. YES. Origin is (00), if not it should be clearly justified

Annotations (2)
1. N/A. For bar graphs/histograms order of bars is based on classical ordering (alphabetical, temporal, from the best to the worse) are better than a random order;
2. YES. Each curve has a legend;
3. N/A. Each bar has a legend;

 Information
1. NO. Curves are on the same scale;
2. NO. The number of curves on a same graph is small (less than 6);
3. YES. Compare curves on a same graphic;
4. NO. A curve cannot be removed without reducing the information;
5. YES. The graphic gives a relevant information to the reader;
6. N/A. If the vertical axis shows averages, it should indicates error bars;
7. NO. It is not possible to remove any objet without modifying the readability of the graphic.

Context:
1. NO. All the symbols are defined and referenced in the text;
2. YES. The graphic produces more information than any other representation (choice of the variable);
3. YES. The graphic has a title;
4. YES. The title is sufficiently self contained to partially understand the graphic;
5. N/A. The graphic is referenced in the text;
6. The text comment the figure.

some general things to say:
- The graph shows the evolution of labor demand during the time so I consider that an evolution graph it is ok. Also for the division of the gender but I will use the same scale in order to be compared. 
- The pints that they haighlight are not x-distant so this values are not comparable. Perhaps they must be seen in a context of the country. 
- I think they show too much information, perhaps could be a good idea to use bar graph divided by gender or something like that. 

 Last but not least : The graphical representation should be elegant
